# Assam Local Guide
# Project Team:
   • **Shubhan Bora** - Lead Developer & Designer
   • **Rohit Das** - Co-Developer & Cultural Researcher
   
A modern web-based cultural assistant for discovering Assam's rich heritage, food, festivals, and traditions.

##  Project Overview

**Theme**: The Local Guide of Assam
**Goal**: Build a clean, modern web UI where users can ask questions about Assam's food, festivals, and culture with context-aware behavior.

##  Features

- **Interactive Q&A System**: Ask questions about Assamese culture and get intelligent responses
- **Context-Aware Logic**: Smart categorization of queries (food, festivals, culture, general)
- **Cultural Showcase**: Visual cards highlighting key aspects of Assamese heritage
- **Modern UI**: Clean, professional design with cultural color scheme
- **Responsive Design**: Works seamlessly across different screen sizes

##  Technology Stack

- **Frontend**: HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript (ES6+)
- **No Backend**: Pure client-side implementation
- **No External APIs**: Self-contained rule-based system
- **Context System**: Custom logic using local product.md file

##  Project Structure

```

##  Design Philosophy

- **Minimal & Elegant**: Clean design that doesn't distract from content
- **Cultural Colors**: Green and red accents representing Assamese heritage
- **Soft Aesthetics**: Rounded cards, subtle shadows, and gentle gradients
- **Professional**: Judge-friendly appearance suitable for hackathon presentation

##  How It Works

### User Interaction Flow
1. User enters a question about Assam culture
2. System analyzes the question using keyword matching
3. Context-aware logic categorizes the query
4. Appropriate response is generated from predefined knowledge base
5. Answer is displayed with smooth animations

### "AI-like" Behavior
The system demonstrates intelligent behavior through:
- **Keyword Analysis**: Matches user input against cultural categories
- **Context Switching**: Different responses based on topic (food, festivals, culture)
- **Confidence Scoring**: Adjusts response style based on match quality
- **Dynamic Responses**: Multiple possible answers for variety

##  Getting Started

1. Clone or download the project files
2. Open `index.html` in any modern web browser
3. Start asking questions about Assam!

No installation or setup required - it's a pure frontend application.

##  Hackathon Highlights

### Why This Approach?
- **Fast Development**: No complex AI infrastructure needed
- **Easy to Explain**: Simple, rule-based logic that judges can understand
- **Scalable**: Easy to add more cultural data and improve responses
- **Demonstrable**: Works immediately without external dependencies

### Kiro's Role in Development
